Can we model political sentiment effectively enough to capture the voting intentions of a nation during an election capaign? We use the recent Irish General Election as a case study for investigating the potential to model political sentiment through mining of social media. Our approach combines sentiment analysis using supervised learning and volume-based measures. We evaluate against the conventional election polls and the ﬁnal election result. We ﬁnd that social analytics using both volume-based measures and sentiment analysis are predictive and we make a number of observations related to the task of monitoring public sentiment during an election campaign, including examining a variety of sample sizes, time periods as well as methods for qualitatively exploring the underlying content.},

Furthermore there have been widely varying methods and models employed with seemingly little agreement on the core criteria required for an accurate estimate. We attempt to address this deficit with our ‘baseline’ model of prediction that incorporates sentiment analysis and prior party support to generate a true forecast of parliament seat allocation.

Our results show that Twitter is used extensively for political deliberation and that the mere number of party mentions accurately reflects the election result. The tweets’ sentiment (e.g., positive and negative emotions associated with a politician) corresponds closely to voters’ political preferences. In addition, party sentiment profiles reflect the similarity of political positions between parties.

This is problematic because while simple approaches are assumed to be good enough, core problems are not addressed. Thus, this article aims to (1) provide a balanced and critical review of the state of the art; (2) cast light on the presume predictive power of Twitter data; and (3) propose some considerations to push forward the field. Hence, a scheme to characterize Twitter prediction methods is proposed. It covers every aspect from data collection to performance evaluation, through data processing and vote inference. Using that scheme, prior research is analyzed and organized to explain the main approaches taken up to date but also their weaknesses. This is the first meta-analysis of the whole body of research regarding electoral prediction from Twitter data. It reveals that its presumed predictive power regarding electoral prediction has been somewhat exaggerated: Social media may provide a glimpse on electoral outcomes but, up to now, research has not provided strong evidence to support it can currently replace traditional polls. Nevertheless, there are some reasons for optimism and, hence, further work on this topic is required, along with tighter integration with traditional electoral forecasting research.},

This is not only an interesting research problem but, above all, it is extremely difficult. However, most of the authors seem to be more interested in claiming positive results than in providing sound and reproducible methods. It is also especially worrisome that many recent papers seem to only acknowledge those studies supporting the idea of Twitter predicting elections, instead of conducting a balanced literature review showing both sides of the matter. After reading many of such papers I have decided to write such a survey myself. Hence, in this paper, every study relevant to the matter of electoral prediction using social media is commented. From this review it can be concluded that the predictive power of Twitter regarding elections has been greatly exaggerated, and that hard research problems still lie ahead.},

Results show that for 60 years, family and grade school have been steadily declining in their influence over the dating market. In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has partly displaced not only family and school, but also neighborhood, friends, and the workplace as venues for meeting partners. The Internet increasingly allows Americans to meet and form relationships with perfect strangers, that is, people with whom they had no previous social tie. Individuals who face a thin market for potential partners, such as gays, lesbians, and middle-aged heterosexuals, are especially likely to meet partners online. One result of the increasing importance of the Internet in meeting partners is that adults with Internet access at home are substantially more likely to have partners, even after controlling for other factors. Partnership rate has increased during the Internet era (consistent with Internet efficiency of search) for same-sex couples, but the heterosexual partnership rate has been flat.},

The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility oppor- tunity, and community organizationis explored.Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well- defined groups.

The results show that both channels are important, but diﬀer across types of movies. We ﬁnd pre-release tweet volume is the most important channel for large franchise movies, generating buzz that inﬂuences box oﬃce earnings on the opening weekend. Demand for mid tier movies responds to increasing awareness driven by the volume of tweets posted after a movie is released. In contrast, the sentiment expressed in online WoM after a movie’s release inﬂuences box oﬃce demand in subsequent weekends for smaller movies.},

	abstract = {Due to the omnipresence of information technology and the increasing popularity of online social networks (OSN), communication behavior has changed. While companies beneﬁt from, i.e., viral marketing campaigns, they are challenged by negative phenomena, like Twitterstorms. Using existing empirical approaches and theories for analyzing the dynamics of social media communication processes and for predicting the success of a campaign is challenging as the circumstances and the access to communication processes have changed. Agent-based social simulation (ABSS) provides approaches to overcome existing restrictions, e.g., privacy settings, and to develop a framework for the dynamic analysis of communication processes, e.g., for evaluating or testing OSN marketing strategies. This requires both a valid simulation model and a set of real world data serving as input for the model. In this paper, a procedure model for the creation of a simulation model is developed and the steps are demonstrated by examples.},

	abstract = {As users interact via social media spaces, like Twitter, they form connections that emerge into complex social network structures. These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics—density, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users—are utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

Based on a network analysis of 2,500 users identified as members of this movement, the visualisation of the “who’s following who?” graph allows us to highlight the structure of the network’s relationships, and identify users whose position is particular. Specifically, we show that linguistic groups are key factors to explain clustering within a network whose characteristics look similar to a small world.},

Candidates tweeted to express their positions, to attack each other, to retweet endorsements, to encourage people to vote, to give news previews, and a lot more. As a result, Twitter has become the most important communication channel for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The more candidates used Twitter to broadcast their thoughts, the more people retweeted them spreading their messages and journalists mentioned tweets in their election coverage creating a virtuous circle that brought more and more attention to the micro-blogging platform.

	abstract = {Social networks have emerged as a critical factor in information dissemination, search, marketing, expertise and inﬂuence discovery, and potentially an important tool for mobilizing people. Social media has made social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive quantities of data for empirical analysis. These data sets offer a rich source of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the structure of networks and global patterns of the ﬂow of information on them. However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was not directly visible but had to be inferred from the ﬂow of information from one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it. We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites. Speciﬁcally, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter, and track how interest in news stories spreads among them. We show that social networks play a crucial role in the spread of information on these sites, and that network structure affects dynamics of information ﬂow.},

Speciﬁcally, we focus on how other users respond to these roots and how the complete conversation initiated by this root evolves over time. For this purpose we focus our investigation on Twitter, the biggest micro-blogging social network. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst such method that is able to reconstruct complete conversations around initial tweets. We propose a robust approach for reconstructing complete conversations and compare the resulting graph structures against those obtained from previous crawling strategies based on keyword searches. Our crawl provides a large scale dataset, ideal for computer scientists to run large scale experimental evaluations, however our dataset is made of a collection of small scale, highly controlled and complete conversation graphs ideal for a sociological investigation. We believe our work will provide the proper dataset to establish concrete collaborations with interdisciplinary expertise.},

	abstract = {Information propagation in a microblog network aims to identify a set of seed users for propagating a target message to as many interested users as possible. This problem differs from the traditional inﬂuence maximization in two major ways: it has a content-rich target message for propagation and it treats each link in the network as communication on certain topics and emphasizes the topic relevance of such communication in propagating the target message. In realistic situations, however, the topics associated with a link are not explicitly expressed but are hidden in the microblogs previously exchanged through the link. In this paper, we present a topic-aware solution to information propagation in a microblog network. We ﬁrst model the latent topic structure of the network using observed microblog messages published in the network. We then present two methods for estimating the propagation probability based on the topic relevance between a link and the target message. Once the propagation probability is estimated, we adopt the standard greedy algorithm for inﬂuence maximization to ﬁnd seed users. This approach is topic-aware in that the target message ﬁnds its way of propagation according to its topic relevance to the latent topic structure in the network. Experiments conducted on real Twitter datasets suggest that the proposed methods are able to select right seed users.},

For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever ﬂows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network ﬂows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that trafﬁc may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of ﬂows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of ﬂow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of trafﬁc and frequency of receiving trafﬁc. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the speciﬁc ﬂow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other ﬂow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the ﬂows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how trafﬁc ﬂows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

Like other social media phenomena, information diffusion is a social process–it is affected by user context, and topic, in addition to the graph topology. This paper studies the impact of different attribute and topology based sampling strategies on the discovery of an important social media phenomena–information diffusion.},

Thereby, it provides a better understanding of the linkage between the use of Twitter by candidates and effects on preferential votes. Two data sources are used to examine this relationship: ﬁrst, a quantitative computer-assisted as well as a manual content analysis of tweets posted by political candidates during the Dutch national elections of 2010 (N = 40,957) and second, a dataset containing the number of votes for electable political candidates during that period. The ﬁndings show that using Twitter has positive consequences for political candidates. Candidates who used Twitter during the course of the campaign received more votes than those who did not, and using Twitter in an interactive way had a positive impact as well.},

In particular, we ask: What predicts the likelihood of an individual becoming aware of a strategic piece of information, or becoming aware of it sooner? Do different types of information exhibit different diffusion patterns, and do different characteristics of social structure, relationships and individuals in turn affect access to different kinds of information? Does better access to information predict an individual’s ability to complete projects or generate revenue? We characterize the social network of a medium sized executive recruiting firm using accounting data on project co-work relationships and ten months of email traffic. We identify two distinct types of information diffusing over this network – ‘event news’ and ‘discussion topics’ – by their usage characteristics, and observe several thousand diffusion processes of each type of information. We find the diffusion of news, characterized by a spike in communication and rapid, pervasive diffusion through the organization, is influenced by demographic and network factors but not by functional relationships (e.g. prior co-work, authority) or the strength of ties. In contrast, diffusion of discussion topics, which exhibit shallow diffusion characterized by ‘back-and-forth’ conversation, is heavily influenced by functional relationships and the strength of ties, as well as demographic and network factors. Discussion topics are more likely to diffuse vertically up and down the organizational hierarchy, across relationships with a prior working history, and across stronger ties, while news is more likely to diffuse laterally as well as vertically, and without regard to the strength or function of relationships. We also find access to information strongly predicts project completion and revenue generation. The effects are economically significant, with each additional “word seen” correlated with about \$70 of additional revenue generated. Our findings provide some of the first evidence of the economic significance of information diffusion in email networks.},

Using empirical data on the spread of news about major international headlines as well as minor topics, we investigate the relative roles of three types of information spreaders: 1) mass media sources like BBC; 2) grassroots, consisting of ordinary users; and 3) evangelists, consisting of opinion leaders, politicians, celebrities, and local businesses. Mass media sources play a vital role in reaching the majority of the audience in any major topics. Evangelists, however, introduce both major and minor topics to audiences who are further away from the core of the network and would otherwise be unreachable. Grassroots users are relatively passive in helping spread the news, although they account for the 98\% of the network. Our results bring insights into what contributes to rapid information propagation at different levels of topic popularity, which we believe are useful to the designers of social search and recommendation engines.},

The drawback is that each community identiﬁed by those methods can only reﬂect the strength of connections, but it cannot reﬂect the semantics such as the interesting topics shared by people. To address this problem, we propose a topic oriented community detection approach which combines both social objects clustering and link analysis. We ﬁrst use a subspace clustering algorithm to group all the social objects into topics. Then we divide the members that are involved in those social objects into topical clusters, each corresponding to a distinct topic. In order to differentiate the strength of connections, we perform a link analysis on each topical cluster to detect the topical communities. Experiments on real data sets have shown that our approach was able to identify more meaningful communities. The quantitative evaluation indicated that our approach can achieve a better performance when the topics are at least as important as the links to the analysis.},

This task in many cases becomes very challenging since the underlying diffusion networks are often hidden, and the topic speciﬁc transmission rates are unknown either. In this paper, we propose a continuous time model, TOPICCASCADE, for topicsensitive information diffusion networks, and infer the hidden diffusion networks and the topic dependent transmission rates from the observed time stamps and contents of cascades. One attractive property of the model is that its parameters can be estimated via a convex optimization which we solve with an efﬁcient proximal gradient based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. In both synthetic and real-world data, we show that our method signiﬁcantly improves over the previous state-of-the-art models in terms of both recovering the hidden diffusion networks and predicting the transmission times of memes.},

On a data set containing approximately 10 million users and a comprehensive scraping of 196 million tweets, we perform a rigorous temporal and spatial analysis, investigating the time-evolving properties of the subgraphs formed by the users discussing each topic. We focus on two diﬀerent notions of the spatial: the network topology formed by follower-following links on Twitter, and the geospatial location of the users. We investigate the eﬀect of initiators on the popularity of topics and ﬁnd that users with a high number of followers have a strong impact on topic popularity. We deduce that topics become popular when disjoint clusters of users discussing them begin to merge and form one giant component that grows to cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the network. Our geospatial analysis shows that highly popular topics are those that cross regional boundaries aggressively.},

Exploiting this additional information, we propose the Twitter-Network (TN) topic model to jointly model the text and the social network in a full Bayesian nonparametric way. The TN topic model employs the hierarchical Poisson-Dirichlet processes (PDP) for text modeling and a Gaussian process random function model for social network modeling. We show that the TN topic model signiﬁcantly outperforms several existing nonparametric models due to its ﬂexibility. Moreover, the TN topic model enables additional informative inference such as authors’ interests, hashtag analysis, as well as leading to further applications such as author recommendation, automatic topic labeling and hashtag suggestion. Note our general inference framework can readily be applied to other topic models with embedded PDP nodes.},

	abstract = {Social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter have been a crucial source of information for a wide spectrum of users. In Twitter, popular information that is deemed important by the community propagates through the network. Studying the characteristics of content in the messages becomes important for a number of tasks, such as breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, friends recommendation, sentiment analysis and others. While many researchers wish to use standard text mining tools to understand messages on Twitter, the restricted length of those messages prevents them from being employed to their full potential.},

Few works systematically investigate how to mine the strength of direct and indirect inﬂuence between nodes in heterogeneous networks.},

	abstract = {In large social networks, nodes (users, entities) are inﬂuenced by others for various reasons. For example, the colleagues have strong inﬂuence on one’s work, while the friends have strong inﬂuence on one’s daily life. How to differentiate the social inﬂuences from different angles(topics)? How to quantify the strength of those social inﬂuences? How to estimate the model on real large networks? To address these fundamental questions, we propose Topical Afﬁnity Propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social inﬂuence on large networks. In particular, TAP can take results of any topic modeling and the existing network structure to perform topic-level inﬂuence propagation. With the help of the inﬂuence analysis, we present several important applications on real data sets such as 1) what are the representative nodes on a given topic? 2) how to identify the social inﬂuences of neighboring nodes on a particular node? To scale to real large networks, TAP is designed with efﬁcient distributed learning algorithms that is implemented and tested under the Map-Reduce framework. We further present the common characteristics of distributed learning algorithms for Map-Reduce. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of TAP on real large data sets.},

Indeed, tweets are routinely integrated into the visual presentation of news and scholarly publishing in the form of summary statistics, tables, and charts provided by commercial analytics software. Without a clear description of how the underlying data were collected, stored, cleaned, and analyzed, however, readers cannot assess their validity. To illustrate the critical importance of evaluating the production of Twitter data, we offer a systematic comparison of two common sources of tweets: the publicly accessible Streaming API and the “fire hose” provided by Gnip PowerTrack. This study represents an important step toward higher standards for the reporting of social media research.},
